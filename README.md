# Hello, I'm Marius 👋

## 🧬 Computational Biologist

I'm a computational biologist focused on understanding biological systems through the lens of single-cell and spatial genomics. As part of my research, I co-develop open-source tools with amazing collaborators to enable myself and others to better analyze complex biological datasets.

## 🚀 Projects that I co-developed

### [CellRank](https://github.com/theislab/cellrank) 
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/theislab/cellrank.svg)](https://github.com/theislab/cellrank/stargazers)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cellrank.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/cellrank/) 
[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/cellrank)](https://pepy.tech/project/cellrank)

A modular framework for studying cellular dynamics using Markov state modeling of multi-view single-cell data. CellRank scales to large datasets, integrates with the scverse ecosystem, and supports applications like fate mapping and trajectory inference.

### [moscot](https://github.com/theislab/moscot)

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/moscot.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/moscot/) 
[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/moscot)](https://pepy.tech/project/moscot)

A framework for Optimal Transport applications in single-cell genomics that scales to large datasets. Supports trajectory inference, spatial mapping, aligning spatial transcriptomics slides, and translating modalities. 

### [CellMapper](https://github.com/quadbio/cellmapper) 
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/quadbio/cellmapper.svg)](https://github.com/quadbio/cellmapper/stargazers)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cellmapper.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/cellmapper/)

k-NN-based mapping of cells across representations to transfer labels, embeddings, and expression values. Works with millions of cells on CPU and GPU across molecular modalities, including spatial and non-spatial data.

### [CellAnnotator](https://github.com/quadbio/cell-annotator) 
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/quadbio/cell-annotator.svg)](https://github.com/quadbio/cell-annotator/stargazers)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cell-annotator.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/cell-annotator/) 
[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/cell-annotator)](https://pepy.tech/project/cell-annotator)

An scverse ecosystem package that uses OpenAI models to automatically annotate cell types in scRNA-seq data based on marker genes. It generates consistent annotations across samples with type, state, and confidence fields.

### [Moslin](https://github.com/theislab/moslin) 
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/theislab/moslin.svg)](https://github.com/theislab/moslin/stargazers)

An algorithm for mapping lineage-traced single cells across time points. Combines gene expression and lineage information to reconstruct differentiation trajectories in complex biological systems.

### [slurm_sweep](https://github.com/quadbio/slurm_sweep) 
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/quadbio/slurm_sweep.svg)](https://github.com/quadbio/slurm_sweep/stargazers)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/slurm_sweep.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/slurm_sweep/)

The missing piece for efficiently running hyperparameter sweeps on SLURM clusters by combining Weights & Biases (W&B) and simple_slurm. Developed to enable efficient parallelization with job arrays while tracking experiments.
